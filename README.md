# spectral_gap
This repository contains code for determining the spectral gap of sandpile dynamics. Documentation with proofs of the computer searches is contained in the .pdf file spectral_gap_comp.pdf. The complete code needed to determine the spectral factors of the fcc and d4 lattices is contained in the files d4.py and fcc.py.
